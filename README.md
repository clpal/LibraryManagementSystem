Welcome to the LMS project!

Java Library Management System â€“ Abstract
The Library Management System (LMS) is a Java-based software application designed to automate and manage the day-to-day operations of a library. This system provides an efficient way to handle book inventory, member records, issue/return transactions, and fine calculations. It minimizes manual workload, improves accuracy, and offers a user-friendly interface for librarians and users.

Key features include:
Book registration, search, and categorization
Member management with borrowing history
Book issue and return tracking
Overdue fine calculation
Admin login for system control and reporting
Developed using Java with Angular  GUI and MySQL (or any relational DBMS), the LMS follows the MVC architecture, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance. This system is ideal for educational institutions and small to mid-sized libraries looking to transition to digital management.
